        :cite:`toro_riemann_2009` for a great overview on numerical methods for
        hyperbolic problems.

        A general problem can be written in a compact way:

        .. math::

            \pdeFull

        The convective term is discretized as follows:

        .. math::

            \numConvectiveFull

        A concrete implementation of this method needs to implement the
        discretization of the numerical flux on **one** face of a cell. It
        needs to implement the term :math:`\numConvective`


        Parameters
        ----------
        cells:
            A :class:`MeshCellSet` containing the state of the mesh cells

        neighs
            A :class:`NeighboursCellSet` containing data of neighbour cells
            corresponding to the :attr:`values`

        Returns
        -------
        F
            The value of the numerical convective flux multiplied by the
            surface value :math:`\numConvective`
