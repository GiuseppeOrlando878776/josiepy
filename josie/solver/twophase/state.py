We create one big state that contains the actual conservative variables that
are used in the flux together with the "auxiliary" variables that are instead
needed, for example, to compute the speed of sound.

The state of system described in :cite:`baer_nunziato` is actually two Euler
states togeter with the state associated to the volume fraction :math:`\alpha`
