class ConvectiveScheme(Scheme):
    r"""
    A mixin that provides the convective scheme implementation.

    A general problem can be written in a compact way:

    ..math::

    \pdv{\vb{q}}{t} + \div{\vb{F\qty(\vb{q})}} + \vb{B}\qty(\vb{q}) \cdot
        \gradient{\vb{q}} = \vb{s\qty(\vb{q})}

    A concrete instance of this class needs to implement the term:

    ..math::

    \int_{V_i} \div{\vb{F}\qty(\vb{q})} \dd{V} =
        \oint_{\partial V_i} \vb{F}\qty(\vb{q}) \cdot \hat{\vb{n}} \dd{S}
    """

    def convective_flux(
        self,
        values: State,
        neigh_values: State,
        normals: np.ndarray,
        surfaces: np.ndarray,
    ):
        r""" This is the convective flux implementation of the scheme. See
        :cite:`toro` for a great overview on numerical methods for hyperbolic
        problems.
        This method implements a scheme as a 1D scheme operating on a cell and
        its neighbour (i.e. the :math:`\mathcal{F}` function in the following
        equation)

        ..math:

        \mathbf{U}_i^{k+1} = \mathbf{U}_i^{k} -
            \frac{\text{d}t}{V} \mathcal{F}
            \left(\mathbf{U}_i^{k}, \mathbf{U}_{i+1}^{k} \right)
