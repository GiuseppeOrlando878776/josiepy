        r""" This is the convective flux implementation of the scheme. See
        :cite:`toro_riemann_2009` for a great overview on numerical methods for
        hyperbolic problems.

        A general problem can be written in a compact way:

        .. math::

            \pdeFull


        A concrete instance of this class needs to implement the discretization
        of the numerical flux on **one** face of a cell. It needs to implement
        the term :math:`\numConvective`

        .. math::

            \numConvectiveFull


        Parameters
        ----------
        values
            The values of the state fields in each cell

        neigh_values
            The values of the state fields in the each neighbour of a cell

        normals
            The normal unit vectors associated to the face between each cell
            and its neigbour

        surfaces
            The surface values associated at the face between each cell and its
            neighbour

        Returns
        -------
        F
            The value of the numerical convective flux multiplied by the
            surface value :math:`\numConvective`
