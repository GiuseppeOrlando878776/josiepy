        r"""This is the diffusive flux implementation of the scheme. See
        :cite:`toro_riemann_2009` for a great overview on numerical methods for
        hyperbolic problems.

        A general problem can be written in a compact way:

        .. math::

            \pdeFull

        The diffusive term is discretized as follows:

        .. math::

            \numDiffusiveFull


        A concrete implementation of this method needs to implement the
        discretization of the numerical diffusive flux on **one** face of a
        cell. It needs to implement the term :math:`\numDiffusive`

        Parameters
        ----------
        values
            The values of the state fields in each cell

        neighs
            A :class:`CellSet` containing data of neighbour cells corresponding
            to the :attr:`values`

        Returns
        -------
        D
            The value of the numerical diffusive flux multiplied by
            the surface value :math:`\numDiffusive`
