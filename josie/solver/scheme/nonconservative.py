        :cite:`toro_riemann_2009` for a great overview on numerical methods for
        hyperbolic problems.

        A general problem can be written in a compact way:

        .. math::

            \pdeFull

        The non-conservative term is discretized as follows:

        .. math::

            \numNonConservativeFull

        A concrete instance of this class needs to implement the discretization
        of the numerical flux on **one** face of a cell. It needs to implement
        the term :math:`\numNonConservative`


        Parameters
        ----------
        values
            The values of the state fields in each cell

        neighs
            A :class:`CellSet` containing data of neighbour cells corresponding
            to the :attr:`values`

        Returns
        -------
        G
            The value of the numerical nonconservative flux multiplied by
            the surface value :math:`\numNonConservative`
