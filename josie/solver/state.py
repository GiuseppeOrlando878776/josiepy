class State(np.ndarray):
    """ :class:`State` is a subclass of :class:`numpy.ndarray`. It behaves like
    a normal :class:`numpy.ndarray` except it has additional init methods to
    ease the usage

    A :class:`State` can be initialized using a :class:`StateTemplate`, or
    directly providing key-value arguments:

    >>> Q = StateTemplate("rho", "rhoU", "rhoV")
    >>> state = np.array([0, 1, 2]).view(Q)
    >>> assert state[state.fields.rho] == 0
    >>> assert state[state.fields.rhoU] == 1
    >>> assert state[state.fields.rhoV] == 2

    A state can be manipulated as a normal :class:`numpy.ndarray`:

    >>> e1 = State([1, 0, 0])
    >>> e2 = State([0, 1, 0])
    >>> e3 = State([0, 0, 1])
    >>> assert np.array_equal(np.cross(e1, e2), e3)

    A :class:`State` can be multidimensional. The last dimension must be the
    number of states defined in the :class:`StateTemplate` call. In this case
    you can get all the values of the state for a specific variable:

    >>> state = np.random.random((10, 10, 3)).view(Q)
    >>> assert np.array_equal(state[..., state.fields.rho], state[..., 0])
    >>> assert np.array_equal(state[..., state.fields.rhoU],state[..., 1])

    It allows you to create at will a :class:`State` class for which you can

    attribute :attr:`fields`, that is an :class:`IntEnum` (and not only by

        A list of (scalar) fields composing the state


    A scalar :class:`State` as for the advection equation
    >>> Q = StateTemplate("u")

    Than you can concretize the state with a value

    of the 2D Euler compressible equations
